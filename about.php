            <p>Hi! I'm Zachary and I'm all about bringing your vision to life on the 
            web. I've got skills like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, and most major
            front-end web development languages, but let's face it- most people in this
            business can write code. What sets me apart is that I go the extra mile.
            </p>
            <p>It starts with understanding your vision. We'll go through the wireframes
            together. I'll ask questions. You'll ask questions. I start building when
            we're both satisfied that we're on the same page, so to speak.
            </p>
            <p>Next, it's iterate, iterate, iterate. Here's where most of that extra
            mile comes in... If I think I can improve your users' experience, I'll mock
            it up to see if you like it. Got a typo/mispelling? I'm good with copy and 
            one of my pet peeves is awkward copy or bad grammar. I'll keep an eye on 
            search engine optimization (SEO) throughout the process. I do one project at 
            a time. My focus is on you and your site.
            </p>
            <p>The story doesn't end when your site is up and running. I pride myself on
            clean, straightforward code. I'll build your site from the ground up to be 
            easy to maintain and easy to tweak, whether or not it's me doing the tweaking.
            </p>
            <p>I'm easy to work with. Diligence and conscientiousness are cornerstones of
            my work ethic. <a href="contact.php">Contact me</a> and let's discuss your project.
