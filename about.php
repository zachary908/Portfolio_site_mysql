			<p>Hi! I'm Zachary and I'm all about bringing your vision to life on the 
			web. I've got skills like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, and most major
			front-end web development languages, but let's face it- most people in this
			business can write code. What sets me apart is that I go the extra mile.
			</p>
			<p>It starts with understanding your vision. We'll go through the wireframes
			together. I'll ask questions. You'll ask questions. I start building when
			we're both satisfied that we're on the same page, so to speak.
			</p>
			<p>Next, it's iterate, iterate, iterate. Here's where most of that extra
			mile comes in... If I think I can improve your users' experience, I'll mock
			it up to see if you like it. Got a typo/mispelling? I'm good with copy and 
			one of my pet peeves is awkward copy or bad grammar. I'll keep an eye on 
			search engine optimization (SEO) throughout the process. I do one project at 
			a time. My focus is on you and your site.
			</p>
			<p>The story doesn't end when your site is up and running. I pride myself on
			clean, straightforward code. I'll build your site from the ground up to be 
			easy to maintain and easy to tweak, whether or not it's me doing the tweaking.
			</p>
			<p>I'm easy to work with. Diligence and conscientiousness are cornerstones of
			my work ethic. <a href="contact.php">Contact me</a> and let's discuss your project.
			</p>
